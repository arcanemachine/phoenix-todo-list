Additional information on deployment. This document is mostly intended for personal use, so some sections may not be relevant to the reader.

## Deploying A Native Phoenix Server

- Ensure that your environment is configured properly.
  - Use the `support/scripts/dotenv-generate` script to create a `.env` file if one doesn't already exist.
  - Ensure that the `.env` file contains the desired values.
- Ensure the required steps have been completed before continuing:
  - Setup Postgres:
    - Using a container:
      - See the "Running a Standalone Postgres Container" in `support/containers/README.md`.
    - Manually:
      - Install the required packages (instructions will work for Debian/Ubuntu environments):
        - `sudo apt update`
        - `sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib`
      - Use a Postgres terminal to create a new database and user:
        - `sudo su - postgres`
        - `psql`
          - `CREATE USER todo_list_user WITH PASSWORD 'todo_list_password';`
          - `CREATE DATABASE todo_list;`
          - `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE todo_list TO todo_list_user;`
        - Exit `psql` by pressing `Ctrl+D` or typing `\q` + `Enter`
  - Setup Caddy using the instructions in the _[Deploying With Caddy](#deploying-with-caddy)_ section.
    - Alternatively, you can set up a different server as you like.
    - Ensure that the domain matches the `PHX_HOST` environment variable, or else Phoenix will complain and websockets (e.g. LiveView) won't work.
- Build a release:
  - Use the `support/scripts/elixir-release-create` script to create a release with Elixir/Mix.
- Ensure that your `PHX_HOST` environment variable matches the domain entered in your browser's address bar.
  - You will probably need to set up Caddy using the instructions below.
    - If you don't set up Caddy, your websockets (e.g. LiveView) probably won't work.
    - Also, Caddy will automatically set up TLS (HTTPS) which is essential for the modern web
      - e.g. Modern browsers will complain when entering passwords if plain HTTP is used.
- To run the server:
  - Using a script:
    - Run migrations and start the server with `supports/scripts/server-prod-start`
  - Manually:
    - Navigate to the directory `_build/prod/rel/todo_list/bin/`.
    - Run migrations: `./migrate`
    - Start the prod server: `./server`
- To stop the server:
  - Using a script: `supports/scripts/server-prod-start`
  - Manually:
    - Navigate to the directory `_build/prod/rel/todo_list/bin/`.
    - Stop the prod server: `./todo_list stop`

### How To Start The Server Automatically When The System Boots

1. Ensure that your environment is configured properly using the instructions in the previous section.

2. Ensure that lingering is enabled for your user account so that services can run on startup:

- `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`

3. Run the `systemd` service file generator in `support/scripts/native-systemd-service-file-generate`.

- This script will place a `systemd` service file called `phoenix-todo-list.service` in the `$USER/.config/systemd/user/phoenix`
- To view the `systemd` service file template in the console instead of writing the file, set the `DRY_RUN=1` environment variable before running the script.

4. The `systemd` service file should now be available in the `$USER/.config/systemd/user/phoenix` directory.

5. Reload the `systemd` daemons: `systemctl --user daemon-reload`

6. Start the service: `systemctl --user start phoenix-todo-list.service`

- Stop the service: `systemctl --user stop phoenix-todo-list.service`

7. To enable the service on startup: `systemctl --user enable phoenix-todo-list.service`

- To disable the service from running on startup: `systemctl --user disable phoenix-todo-list.service`

8. To view the logs for the service (useful for troubleshooting): `journalctl --user -xe --unit phoenix-todo-list`

## Deploying With Containers

To deploy with Docker/Podman containers, see `support/containers/README.md`.

Any non-Traefik deployment strategy can be used with Caddy. To set up Caddy, see the [section below](#deploying-with-caddy)

### Pulling the Newest Image During an Update

You may need to pull the latest image when doing an update:

- Log in to your server.
- Pull the correct image for your CPU architecture:
  - `x86_64`: `podman image pull docker.io/arcanemachine/phoenix-todo-list:x86_64`
  - `aarch64`: `podman image pull docker.io/arcanemachine/phoenix-todo-list:aarch64`

### Adding New Environment Variables

**NOTE: This section is intended for personal reference only. It will likely be of limited value to other readers.**

At the moment, there is a substantial amount of duplication required to add a new environment variable that will persist through the deployment process.

For example, to add the `EMAIL_FROM_DEFAULT` environment variable to all phases of the project, a reference to the value must be added to ONE OR MORE one of the following files:

- The dotenv file generator template:
  - `support/scripts/templates/dotenv`
- The `systemd` service file generator script:
  - `support/scripts/systemd-container-service-file-generate`
- The Compose file for the container that will utilize the new environment variable:
  - e.g. `support/containers/compose.phoenix.yaml` (in the `environment` section)
- The Ansible files associated with this project:
  - **NOTE: These files are not part of this project's repo. This section, in particular, is for personal reference only.**
  - The `secrets.yml` file associated with this project.
  - The Ansible playbook used to deploy this project:
    - Name the variable in the `environment` section of the playbook.
    - Ensure the variable is present in the 'validation' section of the playbook's tasks.

NOTE: Depending on the circumstances, you may not need to add the value to every file. It all depends where and when the value is needed. Think ahead.

## Deploying With Caddy

To deploy with Caddy, complete the following steps:

1. Ensure that Caddy is installed on your machine.

2. Backup the existing Caddyfile just in case:

- `sudo cp /etc/caddy/Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile.bak`

3. There are several example Caddyfiles:

   - `Caddyfile.dev`: Uses 'localhost' subdomain
   - `Caddyfile.vagrant`: Like dev, but sets a manual path for the TLS certificates.
     - This allows a self-signed certificate to be made on the host (e.g. using 'mkcert'), and used in the VM.
     - Designed for use with [Vagrant](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant)
   - `Caddyfile.staging`: Uses a live domain name, but not the production one.
     - e.g. staging.your-project.com
   - `Caddyfile.prod`: Uses a live domain name

4. Copy the desired project's Caddyfile to the Caddy configuration directory:

- dev: `sudo cp Caddyfile.dev /etc/caddy/Caddyfile`
- vagrant: `sudo cp Caddyfile.vagrant /etc/caddy/Caddyfile`
- staging: `sudo cp Caddyfile.staging /etc/caddy/Caddyfile`
- prod: `sudo cp Caddyfile.prod /etc/caddy/Caddyfile`

5. Navigate to the Caddy configuration directory.

- `cd /etc/caddy`

6. Validate the new Caddyfile:

- `sudo caddy validate`

7. Reload the Caddyfile:

- `sudo caddy reload`

8. Caddy should now be working with the new configuration.

- Caddy will automatically enable TLS (HTTPS) for your domain. See the Caddy docs for more info.

### Modifying the Caddyfile

Caddyfiles are quite simple and mostly self-explanatory. Example:

```
phoenix-todo-list.nicholasmoen.com

reverse_proxy localhost:4000
```

After you change the Caddyfile, follow steps 5-7 to load the new configuration.

## Creating `systemd` Services For This Project

### Natively

You can use the `support/scripts/systemd-native-service-file-generate` to easily create a `systemd` service file for this project using a native Phoenix release (i.e. no containers).

When this script is run, it will generate `systemd` service file called `~/.config/systemd/user/phoenix-todo-list.service`

### Using Containers

#### The Easy Way

The helper scripts in `support/scripts/` allow you to easily setup and teardown a user-level `systemd` service for this project.

##### Setup

You can use the `support/scripts/systemd-container-service-bootstrap` to easily create and run a `systemd` service for this project.

- Run `support/scripts/systemd-container-service-bootstrap --help` to learn about configuration options for this script.

##### Teardown

You can use the `support/scripts/systemd-container-service-teardown` to easily stop and disable the service, and remove the service file for this project.

#### Manual Configuration

You can use the `support/scripts/systemd-container-service-file-generate` to easily create a `systemd` service file for this project:

- This script is configured for Docker by default.
  - To generate a Podman container, pass the `--podman` flag when running this script.
- When this script is run, it will generate `systemd` service file called `~/.config/systemd/user/phoenix-todo-list.service` (unless the `--dry-run` flag is set)
- Other flags:
  - `--dry-run` - Display the service file in the terminal instead of writing to a file.
    - No permanent changes are made when this flag is used.
    - The output of a `--dry-run` is identical to the real service file, and can be piped as needed.
  - `--podman` - Configures the service for use with Podman instead of Docker.
  - `--phoenix-expose` - Exposes the PHX_HOST port to the host
  - `--postgres` - Run a Postgres container as part of the service.
  - `--postgres-expose` - Exposes the Postgres container's port 5432 to the host
  - `--traefik-client` - Configures the service to be used as Traefik.
    - Does not start a Traefik server.
  - `--traefik-host` - Configures the service to be used as Traefik.
    - Runs a Traefik container as part of the service.
  - Traefik-specific options:
    - `--dev` - Configures Traefik to work in a dev environment.
      - HTTP only (No HTTPS)
    - `--staging` - Configures Traefik to work in a staging environment.
      - Supports HTTPS certificates via Let's Encrypt, but uses [the Let's Encrypt staging environment](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/)
    - `--prod` - Configures Traefik to work in a production environment.
      - Supports HTTPS certificates via Let's Encrypt

**NOTE:** If using a Postgres container alongside this service, make sure you don't mix up the `POSTGRES_HOST` variables if running multiple instances of the same service simulataneously (e.g. in development). An apparent Postgres connection error may just be a value you forgot to change (or change back) when you were updating the dotenv file so you could get the service up and running. (This one has bitten me a couple times.)

- e.g. `POSTGRES_DB=postgres DATABASE_URL=ecto://postgres:postgres@postgres/todo_list ./support/scripts/systemd-container-service-file-generate --postgres --traefik-client`

After running the `systemd-container-service-file-generate` script:

- The output will be sent here:
  - '~/.config/systemd/user/phoenix-todo-list.service'
- Before you can manage the systemd service, you will need to reload the systemd daemons:
  - systemctl --user daemon-reload
- To enable this service:
  - systemctl --user enable phoenix-todo-list.service
- To start this service:
  - systemctl --user start phoenix-todo-list.service
- In order to start this service on boot, you must enabling lingering for this user:
  - sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
- If you are having issues with the service, you can examine the logs:
  - journalctl --user -xe --unit phoenix-todo-list

## Configuring the Email Provider

By default, this project does not support live email. However, this can be easily configured.

- This project is configured for an easy setup using Amazon SES as the email provider.
- To configure this provider, modify the generated `.env` file in the project root directory.
  - You need to update these 3 environment variables: `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SECRET`
- If the `AWS_SECRET` environment variable is empty, the config in `config/runtime.exs` will not set up any email provider.
  - This provides a failsafe method to opt into an easy-to-use email provider, while not breaking the workflow for any user who doesn't want to enable live email features.

#### Release Checklist

The following tasks should be performed before creating and pushing a release:

- Increment the project's version number in `mix.exs`.
- Describe relevant changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Commit all changes to the primary repo.
- Build and push a container image to Docker Hub (`just deploy`)
