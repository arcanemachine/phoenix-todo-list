# To generate a valid self-signed certificate with 'mkcert':
#   - Ensure that mkcert is installed on the host machine (mkcert is not needed in the VM)
#   - Ensure that a shared Vagrant directory has been created in your Vagrantfile
#     - It should point to '/vagrant' in the VM
#   - Navigate to the shared directory in the host.
#   - Generate the self-signed certificate:
#     - mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem phoenix-todo-list.localhost
#   - Add read permissions to the newly-generated 'key.pem' file:
#     - chmod 644 key.pem
#       - NOTE: Assigning read permissions poses a potential security issue!
#         - To be on the safe side, delete the key when you are done with it!
